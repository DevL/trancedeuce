Transducer experiments in Python.

## What is a transducer?

> A transducer (sometimes referred to as xform or xf) is a transformation from one reducing function to another

From the [Clojure documentation](https://clojure.org/reference/transducers#_terminology)

## What's up with the name of this repository?

I'm being _vaguely_ punny. The inspiration comes from the name of an [80s band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_Dance) and the fact that implementing transducers in something else than Clojure might be considered an [unholy thing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deuce).
